#### Vue Lifecycle Hooks

| Phase      | Lifecycle Method             |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Created    | beforeCreate(), created()    |
| Mounting   | beforeMount(), mounted()     |
| Updated    | beforeUpdate(), updated()    |
| Unmounting | beforeUnmount(), unmounted() |

#### Axios

[https://axios-http.com/docs/intro](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

#### Watchers `(watch)`

We can use the watch option to trigger a function whenever a reactive property changes.

#### Computed Property

Comparision :
**data property (state)**, they are meant for simple operations.
**computed property**, complex logic from `data` and we don't want to repeat calculation/process more than 1.
